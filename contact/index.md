1. Aspiring Minds’ Employability Outcomes 2015 (AMEO 2015):  

It is a unique dataset which contains engineering graduates’ employment
outcomes (salaries, job titles and job locations) along with standardized
assessment scores in three fundamental areas - cognitive skills, technical
skills and personality.  
Coupled with biodata information, AMEO 2015 provides an opportunity for
a unique and comprehensive study of the entry level labor market. The data can
be used not only to make an accurate salary predictor, but also to understand
what influences salary and job titles in the labor market.

Kennedy School, which uses AMEO.

group of Machine Learning class’ students at NYU.

2. Data Science
For Kids:   

We conduct machine learning workshop with kids where, as part of the exercise,
they are supposed to rate random face cards on a scale of 1-5 according to
their inclination to befriend the person on the card. These cards had
distinguishing feature sets like old names & new names, gender and hobby
type. To read more about the workshop and its experiences, click [here](http://www.datasciencekids.org/).   

We collected this ratings data which you can use to design your own predictor
and compare the results. To download the dataset, click [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5e-wnFrLgTEUm9jaDc2ODV5Z3M&usp=sharing).  
  
3.
Programming Features API:  
In our KDD 2014 [paper](http://research.aspiringminds.com/publications/), we describe a new grammar to extract meaningful features
from program which are highly predictive of the algorithm used to solve the
problem. We show how the features work wonders with supervised learning. A
million more things can be done by our features than naive ones like keyword
counts, AST height, syntax errors, etc. They are currently available for C,
C++, Java and Python. Want to try them out? Happy to provide an API.
Write to us!

 

4. Code Data Set:  
We have a data set
of more than 100,000 codes in C, C++ and Java. We also have data sets of human
graded codes in C and Java for various problems. Want to play with it? Write to
us!

 

5.Assessment-Performance Data Set:  
This is a data set we gave out for a machine learning [competition](http://www.aspiringminds.in/mlCompetition/) in 2011.
It contains assessment scores of candidates in multiple areas and their
performance in a company as rated by the managers. Want to try building the
best models for different type1/type2 error trade-offs? Try this!  
  

We’ve also listed out some websites which provide open data on a variety of
subjects. Curious researchers can download and fiddle with data from these sources
and probably come up with some enticing problems that could be solved using
data science and machine learning.  
  

Apart from this, we have tested more than two million candidates in language,
cognitive skills, personality and functional skills. We have various data sets
of company performance on individuals whom we have assessed. If you can think
of joint research projects around this data, do write to us.  
Also, we are a data
hungry group, so if you can provide us any kind of data and have joint research
goals in mind, do write to us.
