Aspiring Minds aspires to build an assessment-driven job marketplace (a SAT/GRE for jobs) to drive accountability in higher education and meritocracy in labor markets. The products developed based on our research has impacted more than two million lives and the resulting data is a source of continuous new research.

### Products and Services
**SVAR:** SVAR enables automated evaluation of fluency, pronunciation, listening and comprehension of English language with consistency and accuracy. SVAR uses advanced speech recognition and machine learning algorithms to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent. It contains sections where the candidate has to respond based on the dialogue s/he hears, repeat or read in English and also speak extempore.

**Automata:** Automata is world's most advanced and only programming assessment that uses machine learning for grading programs. To grade a program, Automata goes beyond the simplistic test case criterion using its patent pending technology. Based on semantic analysis of the program and use of machine learning, Automata grades a program on how close a program’s implementation logic is to a possible correct solution.

**AMCAT:** AMCAT is world’s only adaptive assessment for job skills that predicts job performance for a wide variety of jobs. AMCAT is a multi-dimensional adaptive instrument that measures the knowledge, skills and personality required for multiple job roles.It not only provides an accurate measurement of a candidate’s ability, but also builds on multiple years of data to identify that AMCAT scores accurately predict performance in different jobs.

**Autoview:** It is an AI powered virtual interview platform that mimics actual face to face interview. It automatically evaluates candidates’ body language, voice emotion and answer relevance. Autoview uses NLP techniques to automatically analyze content relevance, structure and grammatical errors. 

**Writex:** It is a machine learning powered assessment of written English. Writex tool is capable of automatically identifying and reporting multiple grammar errors, typographical and spelling errors. It uses NLP to evaluated content score, structure and grammar for the text written by the candidate.

### Team
**Varun Aggarwal:** Varun obtained his Masters in EECS from MIT in 2007. Varun is a recognized expert on developing and applying statistical learning and optimization techniques to real world problems, including circuit modeling and design, parallel processing and network coding. His work has been published in more than 20 technical publications and he has five US patents pending, including for algorithms he developed for Aspiring Minds.He is the founder of the MIT India Reading Group, a platform for collaborative research on socio-economic issues in India, which has completed more than 65 meetings. He also is the co-founder of CURE, an organization working against hazing in India.Varun was awarded the HUMIES award in 2006 for developing algorithms that mimic human intelligence and the AWA award for his article on Bose's contribution to invention of radio. He has been a speaker and panelist at Harvard University, MIT, INSEAD and IBM Research Center (NYC).

**Rohit Takhar:** Rohit received his bachelors in Computer Engineering from NSIT, New Delhi. At Aspiring Minds, he is working on the automatic assessment of programming problems. He is developing algorithms and tools for automated program repair and automated synthesis of correct programs.
