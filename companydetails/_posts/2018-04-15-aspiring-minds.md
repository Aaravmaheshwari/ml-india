Aspiring Minds is a global leader in job skills assessments and credentialing. We envision a merit-driven talent ecosystem enabled by efficient job skills matching enabled with reliable and intelligent assessments. Powered by machine learning, AI, psychometry and statistics, our state-of-the-art assessment tools are used by companies across a wide variety of industries to help them recruit the right people, develop requisite skills benchmarks, and to assess workforce health.

### Products and Services
**SVAR:** SVAR enables automated evaluation of fluency, pronunciation, listening and comprehension of English language with consistency and accuracy. SVAR uses advanced speech recognition and machine learning algorithms to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent.

**Automata:** Automata is world's most advanced and only programming assessment that uses machine learning for grading programs. To grade a program, Automata goes beyond the simplistic test case criterion using its patent pending technology. Based on semantic analysis of the program and use of machine learning, Automata grades a program on how close a program’s implementation logic is to a possible correct solution.

**Autoview:**  It is an AI powered virtual interview platform that mimics actual face to face interview. It automatically evaluates candidates’ body language, voice emotion and answer relevance. Autoview uses NLP techniques to automatically analyze content relevance, structure and grammatical errors. 

**Writex:**  It is a machine learning powered assessment of written English. Writex tool is capable of automatically identifying and reporting multiple grammar errors, typographical and spelling errors. It uses NLP to evaluated content score, structure and grammar for the text written by the candidate. 

Other products include AMCAT, automated motor skill evaluation and automated email grading.
