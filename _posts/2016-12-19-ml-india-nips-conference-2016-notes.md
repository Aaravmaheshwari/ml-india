The Conference and Workshop on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is a machine learning and computational neuroscience conference held every December. The conference is a single track meeting that includes invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations of refereed papers, followed by parallel-track workshops that up to 2013 were held at ski resorts. According to Microsoft Academic Search, NIPS is the top conference on machine learning.

NIPS 2016 recently concluded in Barcelona, Spain. 

This year, the conference had close to 730 accepted papers and posters along with 50+ workshops and tutorials.

The keynote was provided by speakers from FB research, Salk institute, Deep Mind and Boston Dynamics and a couple more. Click [here](https://nips.cc/){:target="_blank"} for more details.
