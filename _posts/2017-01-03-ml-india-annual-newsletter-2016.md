The past year has been great for the Indian machine learning community. With new innovations and solid research, the Indian research in ML has started to pick up a decent pace. ML-India is happy to act as a strong interactive platform for various researchers and practitioners, across India, who like to be up to speed with the latest in ML. 

We are pleased to share our efforts in the past year. During 2016, our activities spanned five domains- interview series, meetups, conference analyses, Data Angels and open data sets. 

We conducted interviews with ML practitioners from academia and industry to know how they are using the power of ML to make their work more efficient and their products 'smarter'. We talked to professors such as [Dr. Nitin Gupta](http://ml-india.org/ml-india-interview-nitin-gupta/){:target="_blank"} from IIT Kanpur, and ML-practitioners in industry such as [Dr. Manish Gupta](http://ml-india.org/ml-india-interview-manish-gupta/){:target="_blank"} from Xerox Research India. They talked about the current research scenario in India and suggested ways to improve it and instil the practice of research among young students.    

We hosted meetups in [Bangalore](http://ml-india.org/ml-chapter/#bangalore){:target="_blank"} and [Gurgaon](http://ml-india.org/ml-chapter/#gurgaon){:target="_blank"} where ML enthusiasts from diverse backgrounds brainstormed ideas and discussed how they could exploit ML in their everyday life. These meetups had speakers from top institutions and research labs who presented their work and talked about the importance of ML in their projects.

Our analyses of top ML conferences is an attempt to highlight India's contribution to the global research community. We sifted through the publications in [NIPS](http://ml-india.org/ml-india-stand-nips-2015/){:target="_blank"}, [KDD](http://ml-india.org/ml-india-stand-in-kdd-2016/){:target="_blank"}, [CVPR](http://ml-india.org/ml-india-stand-cvpr-2015/){:target="_blank"} etc. and put together a comprehensive analysis of submissions from India and other top contributors.

[Data Angels](http://ml-india.org/data-angels/){:target="_blank"} is India's first angel initiative to encourage ML and AI backed technologies. Our angel investors and advisors root for the most innovative machine learning led companies from India. These angels have expertise in machine learning and/or experience in building successful technology companies.

We collated various [Indian data sets](http://ml-india.org/datasets/){:target="_blank"} to help researchers and practitioners conduct fresh research. We accumulated open data sets from government bodies like Census of India, and research labs like Aspiring Minds and Microsoft. We believe that data is an imperative driver for the success of any new technology and want to provide any/all freely available data right here on ML-India.   

We wish that we can continue to assist the machine learning community and devise new ways to instigate and support innovative ideas. 

Happy new year!
